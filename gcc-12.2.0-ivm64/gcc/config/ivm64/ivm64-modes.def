/*  GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals:

    The following 3 variables are defined on every target. They can be used to
    allocate buffers that are guaranteed to be large enough to hold any value that
    can be represented on the target.

    The first two can be overridden by defining them in the target’s mode.def file, 268
    however, the value must be a constant that can determined very early in the
    compilation process.

    The third symbol cannot be overridden.

    BITS_PER_UNIT
    The number of bits in an addressable storage unit (byte). If you do not define
    this, the default is 8.

    MAX_BITSIZE_MODE_ANY_INT
    The maximum bitsize of any mode that is used in integer math. This should be
    overridden by the target if it uses large integers as containers for larger
    vectors but otherwise never uses the contents to compute integer values.

    MAX_BITSIZE_MODE_ANY_MODE
    The bitsize of the largest mode on the target. The default value is the largest
    mode size given in the mode definition file, which is always correct for
    targets whose modes have a fixed size. Targets that might increase the size of
    a mode beyond this default should define MAX_BITSIZE_MODE_ANY_MODE to the
    actual upper limit in ‘machine-modes.def’.  */
